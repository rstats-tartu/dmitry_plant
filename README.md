# Data description

- Fc_Plant.xls – photosynthesis data. 
QY_max – max quantum yield of PSII. 
Time course – 8 timepoints
Position – in the tray ABCD, not important – exclude 2 points from position – named “empty”
Plant name – treatment name LT – low temp, HW – high water LL-low light, LC - low C02
70 plants, 8 timepoints, each plant measured once in each timepoint.
Stomata opening – genotype column col0 – wt, 3 mutants with more close stomatas ht1-2, ht1-4, ht1-5
In each exp combinations of LW and HW combined with HL & LL – 4 combinations.

- Whether any of mutants differ from wt in any
Also 2 lines with open stomata – MES5, MES7 – these also in comparison with wt.
Y – yield of PSII; 

- File: Ir_Plant.xls
Y – Temp-avg. Same plants, same timepoints (4 timepoints).

- File : Rgb_Morpho.xlsx
Y – area_mm

- File ScalesMeasure.xlsx
Y – weight (g)
