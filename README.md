# Data description

__Fc_Plant.xls__ – photosynthesis data. 

- QY_max - max quantum yield of PSII. 
- Time course – 8 timepoints
- Position – in the tray ABCD, not important – exclude 2 points from position – named “empty”
- Plant name – treatment name LT – low temp, HW – high water LL-low light, LC - low C02
- 70 plants, 8 timepoints, each plant measured once in each timepoint.
- Stomata opening – genotype column col0 – wt, 3 mutants with more close stomatas ht1-2, ht1-4, ht1-5
- In each exp combinations of LW and HW combined with HL & LL – 4 combinations.
- Whether any of mutants differ from wt in any
- Also 2 lines with open stomata – MES5, MES7 – these also in comparison with wt.
- Y – yield of PSII; 

__Ir_Plant.xls__

- Y – Temp-avg. Same plants, same timepoints (4 timepoints).

__Rgb_Morpho.xlsx__

- Y – area_mm

__ScalesMeasure.xlsx__

- Y – weight (g)
